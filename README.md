# Dotfiles

My lazy dotfiles with Nix and Dotter.

# Install

To set up your environment using these files, you need to build with Nix and use a symlink with Dotter. 
First, install Nix (you don't need to install Dotter separately, as it will be installed by Nix).

**TODO: write how to install Nix**
Mac:

``` shell
xcode-select --install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install

```

Linux:

``` shell
sudo apt install git curl xz-utils
```
